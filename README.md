# stats220

This is my repo for STATS 220. 

A little about me:

- I am undertaking a degree in Statistics and Operations and Supply Chain Management
- I am taking STATS 220 because I want to improve my skills using R for data acquisition and manipulation.
- I am interested in learning about the most efficient ways of doing these things.
